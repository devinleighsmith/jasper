key questions(for Wade):
why do you want to shard?
    system load
    amount of data stored in mongodb
    current status of mongodb in emerald
what about backups?
is mongodump/restore a viable option? do we even need to restore?
Are current releases handled in ArgoCD or some other way?
Let's discuss a release process for this mongo change.


what will be the shard key?
    high cardinality
    low frequency of individual values
    useanalyzeshardkey 
whether to shard all of the collections
how many shards?
how many members in a shard rs?
how many configuration servers?

mostly for notes and annotations:
    notes are aribitraty text fields with labels and tags and relate those notes to a file.
    file based queries
    user based queries
annotations 
    annotations are text fields that are against a document.
    document related queries
    file id

use mongodump and mongorestore
    can directly dump all databases, collections to a directory, and then restore to a sharded cluster.
    then you can reshard all of the collections
    when resharding, you can evaluate the performance of the index as described here:
